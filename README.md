INTRO

Echo1 is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of flying autonomously or piloted. It is designed as a tri-rotor, and the way that the UAV engages the rotors allows for vertical take offs, landings, and smooth lateral movements while in flight. Each rotor rotates the opposite direction to cancel the yaw movement generated by the rotor assembly. One of the motors is equipped with a servo motor which is mainly used to address the lifting angle. The frame is shaped as wide fixed wing Y and a square box dynamically inserted in the middle for increased stability control while hovering. The additional function of the square box is a cargo bay for the onboard avionics. The UAV only requires three inputs while in flight and the rotors are designated as left front rotor (LFR), right front rotor (RFR), and the rear rotor assembly (RRA).  Echo1 is designed as an endurance UAV, aided by photovoltaic technology to maximize flight time.
